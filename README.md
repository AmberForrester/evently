### Steps to Install

Set up the project locally on your machine by following these steps. 
Keep in mind, they are specific to using Windows.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AmberForrester/evently
  ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
  ```bash
  cd evently
  ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies:** 

Run the following command to install the project dependencies using npm:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project directory and add the following:
   ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
    SIGNING_SECRET=

    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

    MONGODB_URI=

    UPLOADTHING_SECRET=
    UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=
    UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=''

    NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

    NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000/
   ```

Use the key provided after creating your account and new project with [](). 

5. **Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`**

> [!CAUTION]
> To ensure your sensitive information does not get committed to version control:
  - Open (or create) the `.gitignore` file in the root directory.
  - Add the following line to the file:
   ```
   .env.local
   ```

This step will prevent the `.env.local` file from being tracked by Git and keep your sensitive credentials secure. 



### How to Run the Application

1. Open your terminal in the project directory and run the following command: 
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Paste `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the project.
